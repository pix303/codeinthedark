## How to Use


## Developing
Here's how to install the dependencies and run the editor locally:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

To build the editor, run:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
This will compile all scripts and styles and inline them into a single html file in the `dist/` folder. It will also create a `dist/assets/` folder, which separately contains the instructions and page screenshot so that they can easily be changed between different rounds of the competition.

## Contributing
Contributions to the editor welcome. If you've fixed a bug or implemented a cool new feature that you would like to share, please feel free to open a pull request here.
